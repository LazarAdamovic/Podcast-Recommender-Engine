Hi! Welcome to my project. I created a working model of a podcast recommender engine as my final project for my data science course at lighthouse labs. This is a working model of the project, but I am still developing and testing new models and features.

FILES:

1-EDA_podcast_recommender.ipynb ==> is exploratary data analysis

2-podcast_recommender_project.ipynb ==> is experimenting wth several different recommender models

Database download: 

(files were too large for github) There are 3 files in this folder. One is the SQL query results, the second is the database created at the end of 1==> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bS-QMewZ4B-ciUBJwIhRbGQH0excVmkS?usp=sharing

VALUE STATEMENT:
What truly creates value for any streaming app is a good recommendation system. This is especially true for podcasts. There are many free podcast applications that are extremely well designed, however, what can distinguish a paid application from a free application is a strong recommender system. That's why I challenged myself to create a powerful podcast recommendation system.
