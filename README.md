Hi! Welcome to my project. I created working model of a podcast recommender engine as my final project for my data science course at lighthouse labs.


1-EDA_podcast_recommender.ipynb ==> is a text exploratary data analysis

5-Soup_and_Cosine_model.ipynb ==> is several different recommender models

Value statment:
What truly creates value for any streaming app is a good reommendation system. This is especially true for podcasts. There are many free podcast applications that are extremely well designed, however what can distinguish a paid application from a free application is a strong recommender system. That's why I challenged myself to create a powerful podcast recommendation system.

For my data I used someone's online web scrape of podcasts and podcast reviews. I then combined the databases using SQLlite.
