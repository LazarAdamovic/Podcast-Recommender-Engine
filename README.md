# Podcast-Recommender-Engine

Hi! Welcome to my project. It is a work in progress.

List of notebooks:
1-EDA.ipynb is a text exploratary data analysis and using BERT 
5-Soup_and_Cosine_model.ipynb is several different recommender models


My Goal is to create a recommendation engine using customer reviews. What truly creates value for any streaming app is a good reommendation system. This is especially true for podcasts. There are many free podcast applications that are extremely well designed, however what can distinguish a paid application from a free application is a strong recommender system. That's why I challenged myself to create a powerful podcast recommendation system.
